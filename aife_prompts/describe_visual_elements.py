describe_visual_elements = """Describe the visual elements of this page by addressing the following questions and tasks:

1. What chart elements, tables, schematics, and/or other specialised layouts are shown? Describe each one that is shown, including:
   - Statistical and comparative: bar charts, line charts, pie charts, scatter plots, area charts, heat maps, box plots, histograms, bubble charts, radar charts, funnel charts, etc.
   - Relationship and flow: tree graphs, network graphs, Venn diagrams, tree maps, Sankey diagrams, chord diagrams, force-directed graphs, etc.
   - Temporal and spatial: time series plots, Gantt charts, candlestick charts, geographic thematic maps, flow maps, etc.
   - Tables, schematics and other visualisations of data and/or logic.

2. For each chart element, convey all the knowledge you obtained from it:
   - For those with labelled data, present each piece of data and its significance with linear narratives.
   - For those without labelled data, convey the logic and conclusions you obtained.

3. For each table, endeavour to extract all cell contents in all rows and columns, preserving their precise original appearance. Avoid omitting any information or data from any cell.

4. For each schematic and any text with specialised layouts, endeavour to convey all the logic and conclusions you obtained from it.

If no such visual elements are shown, simply state that this page has no visual elements to describe.
